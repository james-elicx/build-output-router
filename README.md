The Build Output Router was originally designed for Cloudflare's [next-on-pages](https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages) project, where it handles hundreds of millions of requests a day on Cloudflare Pages.

This repository became the home for the core router (while preserving old Git history) to enable it to be re-usable as a generic router for all Build Output API (v3) projects.

> [!NOTE]
> It is recommended to lock the version you use to a specific patch release.
